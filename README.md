# Danverse
Dan's Universe 

(This is gonna be a great project)

it's an initiative by me that goes this way: 

1. I've decided to make this such that, it will contain numerous verities of web apps.

2. It will act as Doraemon's Pocket for web apps.

3. From small apps like counters, converters, calculators etc. to big projects like code editors, advanced drawing canvases etc. everything will be found at one place i.e. in this 

      ## "Danverse"
4. It is going to be open source.

5. Anyone throughout the world can contribute there small or big projects  to this platform.

6. In the beginning, it'll be all free. But if the project booms, the contributors will get paid.
